# LoopedHRM

A research codebase for **Two-Level Adaptive Compute — Hierarchical Iterative Solver** with Sudoku as the first environment.

This repository is intentionally scaffolded as a skeleton. It captures project structure, conceptual interfaces, and implementation placeholders while preserving the core design goals:

- iterative latent refinement (Looped-style)
- hierarchical reasoning stages (HRM-style)
- learned halting at both refinement and segment levels
- adaptive compute allocation based on puzzle difficulty

## Project Status

🚧 Early scaffold stage. Modules currently contain interfaces and TODO markers.

## Core Research Goal

Learn **how much computation to use** while solving structured reasoning tasks.

Two compute levels are modeled as interacting modules:

1. **Lower module** for local latent refinement (variable refine-step bursts)
2. **Upper module** for global update, evaluation, and continuation/stop decisions

The model should learn to stop both levels dynamically and allocate lower/upper compute based on puzzle difficulty.

## Quick Start (uv)

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run python scripts/train.py --config configs/experiment/sudoku_baseline.yaml
```

> The training pipeline is not yet implemented; current scripts are placeholders.  
> `uv run ...` automatically uses the project environment, so manual activation is optional.

## Sudoku Dataset Source

This project now expects Sudoku data in the **HRM dataset format** (generated by
`dataset/build_sudoku_dataset.py` from https://github.com/sapientinc/HRM).

Place the generated data folder under `data/` (for example `data/sudoku-extreme-full`)
so `looped_hrm.data.sudoku_dataset.SudokuDataset` can load `train/` and `test/` splits.
Alternatively all scripts that use a dataset can be pointed to a directory.

## Pre-merge Testing Workflow

Use this workflow before merging dataset-loader changes.

1. Install dependencies (runtime + dev/test):
   ```bash
   uv sync --extra dev
   ```
2. Run unit tests:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest -q
   ```
3. Run synthetic smoke test (no external data required):
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/validate_sudoku_dataset.py --self-test
   ```
4. Validate against a real HRM dataset folder (if available):
   ```bash
   uv run python scripts/validate_sudoku_dataset.py --dataset-path data/sudoku-extreme-full
   ```
```

## Development Priorities

1. Implement Sudoku dataset and difficulty buckets.
2. Implement latent state update/refinement module.
3. Implement dual halting heads:
   - refinement halt
   - segment halt
4. Add training objective balancing correctness vs compute penalty.
5. Instrument compute-usage metrics by difficulty.

## Design Source

See `docs/design_doc.md` for the full conceptual plan and constraints.
